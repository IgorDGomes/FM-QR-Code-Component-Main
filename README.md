## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While making this project, I could review about box-shadow and text-shadow.

```css
.main {
  box-shadow: 0 15px 40px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
}
```

### Continued development

I'll keep trying to improve my CSS and will start doing some projects with JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [text-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow) - This made me remember somethings I've forgotten.
- [box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - It made me know about spread-radius value.
